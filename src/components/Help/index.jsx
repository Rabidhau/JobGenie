        You can use Jobejee and search for jobs at Jobejee without registering an account with us. You can also choose to apply for jobs externally whether or not you have an account.
The benefits of registering an account and apply via Jobejee are that you get access to all the Jobejee features which are designed to make every step of your job application process easy. For example: you get job recommendations which are jobs our intelligent algorithm thinks that you might be interested in: so you get them delivered to you without searching for them. If you apply for a job through Jobejee, you will also get notified anytime your application makes progress and whenever you get called in for an interview: so you don’t miss getting contacted by employers.
